## Status & ToDo : Under Development
    
* move the example data from DropBox to Figshare, ...

## Learning Objectives 

* Describe the features of a FASTQ file
* Manipulate FASTQ files

## Lesson 

### Example data

An example FASTQ file can be downloaded [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4121271/DataCarpentry/ERR754084_1.100.fastq) or through 
    
```
wget https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4121271/DataCarpentry/ERR754084_1.100.fastq
```

This is a subset of 100 records of a real FASTQ file from [this](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3279) experiment. The original dataset can be downloaded as follows: ** Be aware this file is large: 1.6 GB! **
    
```
# HUGE FILE
wget ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754084/ERR754084_1.fastq.gz
```

## Purpose of FASTQ

FASTQ is a multi-fasta-like format which is the standard format generated by (most) next-generation sequencing platforms. This file is generated by the base-calling pipeline of the platform and contains the sequence and a quality score for each base. This is usually the raw input files you obtain from a service provider.

## FASTQ format

Download the example FASTQ file and have a look at the first 4 lines

```
head -n 4 ERR754084_1.100.fastq
```

These 4 lines make up a FASTQ record. In a FASTQ file there are usually millions of records. Each record consists of 4 lines:
    
* header for the sequence, always starts with '@'
* sequence
* header for the quality score, always starts with '+'. Often abbreviated to just '+' if it's the same as the sequence header (line 1)
* the quality score for each base of the sequence
